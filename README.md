# Customer Segmentation Analysis

Introduction
It is important for every organisation to know its customers. By knowning them, they can effectively take measures if they are divided into smaller groups and it is termed as Customer Segmentation. 

This is possible with the help of the K-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm is used to divide the customer features into groups of K-clusters, which can then be visualised and understood to achieve a certain goal.

Customer segmentation is the process of categorising consumers based on segmentation parameters such as demographic, geographic, or behaviour factors. To better understand the consumer, we may analyse the given data and use their features to better understand them.

Customer segmentation may help with customer happiness, retention rates, and even price optimisation. Its primary purpose is to identify and prioritize the best among a group of consumers and take the appropriate actions.
